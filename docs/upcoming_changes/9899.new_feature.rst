Add NUMBA_CACHE_LOCATOR_CLASSES environment variable and InTreeCacheLocatorFsAgnostic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new environment variable `NUMBA_CACHE_LOCATOR_CLASSES` has been added
that allows users to override the default cache locator classes and their order.
This variable accepts a comma-separated list of locator class names.

Additionally, a new cache locator class ``InTreeCacheLocatorFsAgnostic`` has been
introduced. This locator is a subclass of ``InTreeCacheLocator`` that is agnostic
to filesystem differences, particularly timestamp precision differences (e.g.,
milliseconds vs seconds). This helps ensure cache consistency across different
filesystems and environments.
