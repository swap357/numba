Fix AzureCI memory limit failures
---------------------------------

Resolved AzureCI test failures caused by memory limit exhaustion. Windows 
systems experienced system service failures, and LLVM code bloat on ``znver3`` 
CPUs exacerbated memory usage.

Implemented ``_NUMBA_REDUCED_TESTING=1`` environment variable to reduce test 
cases, primarily targeting ``test_np_functions.py``. Reduced testing only 
applies to Windows tests on Azure.
